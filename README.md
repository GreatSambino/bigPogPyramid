# bigPogPyramid
Silly little project to test automated input and GUI in python.

Automatically types emote "pyramids" for Twitch chat. Does so very quickly thus reducing the likelihood that somebody breaks your beautiful pyramid, which would bring great shame. Also works with messaging apps like Discord. Adjust the rate at which messages are sent to get around pesky rate-limiting and anti-spam.
